# âœ¨ EnhanceMe: Authentic profiles powered by psychology, personal branding techniques, and code

> Weâ€™re building the software infrastructure for emotionally intelligent self-presentation â€” starting with dating, expanding into wellness, and powered by personal growth.

EnhanceMe is a digital consulting platform and product studio based in Vancouver, Canada.  
We help people present their authentic selves online with clarity and confidence, blending personal branding, professional photography, and psychological insight.

Behind the scenes, weâ€™re also building the technology to scale human connection:
- AI-assisted profile generation and tone matching
- A scalable dossier framework reviewed by counselors
- Tools to help individuals become their own relationship experts
